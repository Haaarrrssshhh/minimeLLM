Most spontaneos trip,"Turns out I stay up the whole night and figure maybe 2 or 3 different iternaries for a nice 7 day trips in the hills of Meghalaya.
Turns out next few days I call all of them and it turns out my friends are no different than the one's we see in memes , this I say because after saying a yes , 2 days before booking the tickets, Femin cancels , followed bhi Shivani and so on. Turns out only Rutvi and Rana are the ones going of the 8. Suddenly a 7 day plan turns out to be 4 and suddenly a group of 8 people who knew each other since 5 years, goes to 8 mix and match.
That being said the plan comes into motion. We did go. turns out a mix and match is not so bad you see. We bonded with each other so much. Drunk nights blurry lights in reality. Clubbing by 1 and beach by 2 , sunrise at the beach by 5am. Not too bad for a trip everyone was unsure about. Bike rides and not to forget the Auroville Ashram, where we sat and meditated. The highlight of the trip being the kayaking in the Backwater and mangroves. Well turns out the best 4 days of my life , when we got back I did record everyone's reaction and at times I do see that video and it just warms me in this cold winter in California.

Have you published any papers or articles?,"I have made 2 major publications 
First was  ""A Comparative Study of Widely Used Image Detection Algorithms"" , is where I began my journey in the field of AI.
The paper ""A Comparative Study of Widely Used Image Detection Algorithms"" by Harsh Zota and Manoj Dhande examines six prevalent image detection algorithms: YOLO (You Only Look Once), HOG (Histogram Oriented Gradients), Fast R-CNN (Fast Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network), R-CNN (Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network), R-FCN (Region-Based Fully Convolutional Network), and SSD (Single Shot Detector). Each algorithm is assessed for its effectiveness in various scenarios based on speed, accuracy, and complexity. YOLO is highlighted for its real-time object detection capability, HOG for its detailed feature extraction, Fast R-CNN and R-CNN for their regional proposal methods, R-FCN for detecting minute details with high speed and accuracy, and SSD for handling low-resolution images effectively. The study aims to guide readers in selecting the most suitable algorithm for their specific project requirements by detailing the pros and cons of each method and providing use-case scenarios where each algorithm excels.

Another paper I wrote was
""A Mobile Application for Handwritten Text Recognition"" by Ved Bhanushali, Harsh Zota, Krimesh Shah, and Dr. Manimala Mahato focuses on developing a mobile application to convert handwritten documents into text. The project aims to address challenges faced by educators during the pandemic, such as grading handwritten assignments submitted as PDFs. Utilizing algorithms like CNN, RNN, and CTC, the application processes scanned or uploaded images of handwritten text, pre-processes them to improve clarity, and segments the text into characters and words for recognition. The model, trained on the IAM dataset, is integrated into an Android application, enabling offline text recognition with high accuracy. The paper also reviews relevant literature and details the methodology, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, and deployment. The developed application aims to streamline the process of converting handwritten notes to digital text, facilitating easier storage, editing, and grading.
It was also my final year project."
What projects have you worked on?,"Although I have done many projects, I would like to highlight a few main ones, which also defines my journey in LLM and AI

MyRecipe
The AI-Powered Recipe Recommendation System project, conducted from March to April 2024, developed a system that suggests recipes based on available ingredients using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The project involved several steps: collecting data from sources like Kaggle and AllRecipes, preprocessing the data to standardize ingredients, and performing feature engineering using techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. The model was developed using collaborative and content-based filtering approaches, with a hybrid model improving recommendation accuracy. The system was evaluated using metrics like precision and recall, and user feedback was incorporated for continuous improvement.

The final system was deployed as a web application using Flask, with containerization via Docker to ensure scalability and reliability. The application features a user-friendly interface where users can input their ingredients to receive recipe recommendations. The code provided includes steps for preprocessing, model training, and deployment, demonstrating the project's comprehensive approach to creating an effective recipe recommendation system that enhances cooking experiences and reduces food waste.

MiniMe
The ""MiniME - Personalized Chatbot for Self-Introduction"" project involves developing a chatbot that uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide detailed and accurate responses about oneself. The process begins with data collection, including curating personal information and extracting data from public profiles. After preprocessing the text data, which includes cleaning, tokenizing, and normalizing, the project leverages word embeddings and context-aware embeddings using models like BERT or GPT-3. These embeddings represent text data in a high-dimensional vector space. A pre-trained language model is fine-tuned on the curated dataset to generate personalized responses.

The model development phase involves selecting and fine-tuning a suitable transformer model, followed by rigorous evaluation using metrics like perplexity and BLEU scores, along with user feedback. The chatbot is deployed using a Flask web application, with RESTful APIs handling user queries and Docker ensuring scalability. This project effectively combines NLP techniques and machine learning to create a personalized, interactive chatbot for self-introduction, enhancing user engagement and providing accurate information.

Sentinex AI - The ""SentixAI - Sentiment Tracker for Personal Notes"" project involved developing a sentiment analysis tool integrated into a personal notes application using natural language processing (NLP) and a fine-tuned BERT model. The project began with collecting and preprocessing personal notes and sentiment-labeled datasets, followed by fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model to achieve 80% accuracy in sentiment classification. The sentiment tracker was implemented into the application to analyze user notes in real-time, providing sentiment scores (positive, negative, or neutral). 

The system's deployment involved creating a Flask API and using Docker for scalability. The impact of the sentiment tracker was quantified through user surveys, revealing a 30% increase in self-awareness among users, who reported gaining valuable insights into their emotional well-being. This project effectively combined advanced NLP techniques and user feedback to enhance self-awareness and emotional intelligence.
