Personal Information - 
I come from a Software Development background which I am very proficient at. Along with that I am extremely good at understanding intricate small business models, dealing with stakeholders and explaining tech to them in a way they understand. I am also very much interested in Data Analysis and anything to do with data. I have not much experience with data but I wish to work hard and learn. The reason I would be a best fit is because I have a hunger to learn to grow and become better. A lot of times there is a question, how many hours can you commit a week, people say 40 , I say 168hours, that too because god has put a limit on those numbers, else I would put even more. I have been an active part of an organisation in India, Change is Us, we as a group did a lot of social work, helping with Old age homes, Orphanage homes and religiously went for beach cleanup every sunday, well I tried to go every alternate sunday.I may not seem the best candiate in this ATS or whatever , but get to know me you will find me as the most hardworking individual who wants to achieve something. 
I  come from a Gujrati family based in Mumbai, I cannot complain that my family or parents are of a backward thinking. They have always supported me but I did have my fair share of problems. Since 2020 covid things had become rough and I had to give up on a lot of things and take up responsibilities.I wanted to come for my masters in 2021 post my bachelors but as I said there were a few issues. But now after 2 years working and a lot of efforts and learning I have come to become a full individual and I can say proudly I have come a long way.
The journey , the long road I have come to and the way ahead ,inspite of all hardships, motivates me. See myself grow and nurture , motivates me every single day.
I remember a so called cold night in November on my bed and I was just like I have to go for a trip with my Undergraduate buddies. Turns out I stay up the whole night and figure maybe 2 or 3 different iternaries for a nice 7 day trips in the hills of Meghalaya.
Turns out next few days I call all of them and it turns out my friends are no different than the one's we see in memes , this I say because after saying a yes , 2 days before booking the tickets, Femin cancels , followed bhi Shivani and so on. Turns out only Rutvi and Rana are the ones going of the 8. Suddenly a 7 day plan turns out to be 4 and suddenly a group of 8 people who knew each other since 5 years, goes to 8 mix and match.
That being said the plan comes into motion. We did go. turns out a mix and match is not so bad you see. We bonded with each other so much. Drunk nights blurry lights in reality. Clubbing by 1 and beach by 2 , sunrise at the beach by 5am. Not too bad for a trip everyone was unsure about. Bike rides and not to forget the Auroville Ashram, where we sat and meditated. The highlight of the trip being the kayaking in the Backwater and mangroves. Well turns out the best 4 days of my life , when we got back I did record everyone's reaction and at times I do see that video and it just warms me in this cold winter in California.


Biggest Achievement- 
Personal - My personal biggest achievement was going into good shape. I was fat due to hereditary as my dad was too. I lacked personality and was extremely introvert because of the same. Making friends was difficult and talking to people too. Then came my engineering where my life turned, I went from a whopping 97kgs to 70kgs, a major loss in weight , which brought not only gain in muscle but also in personality and then I became a major extrovert.
Academic - My biggest academic achievement was when I published my first research paper.
That was hours and hours of research, testing and then finalising a paper.

Academic Achievements
I do not have a lot of academic achievements, but there are a few which I would like to mention
In year 2020 in January right before covid I along with my team took part in Smart India Hackathon(SIH) which is the biggest hackathon in india. There we chose a topic was to fight the current job platforms like linkedin.
What we thought of is making a job platform which was AI powered , such applications were not prominent , especially back in 2020. We used jaccard analysis to find similarity between the users profile and the job description to suggest best possible jobs for the user.
With this we ended up securing a 2nd place on a college level and went ahead to participate in the national level.


Other hackathon I took part on was Inrix Hack which recently happened, we had to use inrix apis, Inrix being a tech companies which was into making maps like google maps. It caters to mainly supply chain businesses


Publications
I have made 2 major publications 
First was  "A Comparative Study of Widely Used Image Detection Algorithms" , is where I began my journey in the field of AI.
The paper "A Comparative Study of Widely Used Image Detection Algorithms" by Harsh Zota and Manoj Dhande examines six prevalent image detection algorithms: YOLO (You Only Look Once), HOG (Histogram Oriented Gradients), Fast R-CNN (Fast Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network), R-CNN (Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network), R-FCN (Region-Based Fully Convolutional Network), and SSD (Single Shot Detector). Each algorithm is assessed for its effectiveness in various scenarios based on speed, accuracy, and complexity. YOLO is highlighted for its real-time object detection capability, HOG for its detailed feature extraction, Fast R-CNN and R-CNN for their regional proposal methods, R-FCN for detecting minute details with high speed and accuracy, and SSD for handling low-resolution images effectively. The study aims to guide readers in selecting the most suitable algorithm for their specific project requirements by detailing the pros and cons of each method and providing use-case scenarios where each algorithm excels.


Another paper I wrote was
"A Mobile Application for Handwritten Text Recognition" by Ved Bhanushali, Harsh Zota, Krimesh Shah, and Dr. Manimala Mahato focuses on developing a mobile application to convert handwritten documents into text. The project aims to address challenges faced by educators during the pandemic, such as grading handwritten assignments submitted as PDFs. Utilizing algorithms like CNN, RNN, and CTC, the application processes scanned or uploaded images of handwritten text, pre-processes them to improve clarity, and segments the text into characters and words for recognition. The model, trained on the IAM dataset, is integrated into an Android application, enabling offline text recognition with high accuracy. The paper also reviews relevant literature and details the methodology, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, and deployment. The developed application aims to streamline the process of converting handwritten notes to digital text, facilitating easier storage, editing, and grading.
It was also my final year project.


Projects
Although I have done many projects, I would like to highlight a few main ones, which also defines my journey in LLM and AI


MyRecipe
The AI-Powered Recipe Recommendation System project, conducted from March to April 2024, developed a system that suggests recipes based on available ingredients using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The project involved several steps: collecting data from sources like Kaggle and AllRecipes, preprocessing the data to standardize ingredients, and performing feature engineering using techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. The model was developed using collaborative and content-based filtering approaches, with a hybrid model improving recommendation accuracy. The system was evaluated using metrics like precision and recall, and user feedback was incorporated for continuous improvement.


The final system was deployed as a web application using Flask, with containerization via Docker to ensure scalability and reliability. The application features a user-friendly interface where users can input their ingredients to receive recipe recommendations. The code provided includes steps for preprocessing, model training, and deployment, demonstrating the project's comprehensive approach to creating an effective recipe recommendation system that enhances cooking experiences and reduces food waste.

MiniMe
The "MiniME - Personalized Chatbot for Self-Introduction" project involves developing a chatbot that uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide detailed and accurate responses about oneself. The process begins with data collection, including curating personal information and extracting data from public profiles. After preprocessing the text data, which includes cleaning, tokenizing, and normalizing, the project leverages word embeddings and context-aware embeddings using models like BERT or GPT-3. These embeddings represent text data in a high-dimensional vector space. A pre-trained language model is fine-tuned on the curated dataset to generate personalized responses.


The model development phase involves selecting and fine-tuning a suitable transformer model, followed by rigorous evaluation using metrics like perplexity and BLEU scores, along with user feedback. The chatbot is deployed using a Flask web application, with RESTful APIs handling user queries and Docker ensuring scalability. This project effectively combines NLP techniques and machine learning to create a personalized, interactive chatbot for self-introduction, enhancing user engagement and providing accurate information.

Sentinex AI - The "SentixAI - Sentiment Tracker for Personal Notes" project involved developing a sentiment analysis tool integrated into a personal notes application using natural language processing (NLP) and a fine-tuned BERT model. The project began with collecting and preprocessing personal notes and sentiment-labeled datasets, followed by fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model to achieve 80% accuracy in sentiment classification. The sentiment tracker was implemented into the application to analyze user notes in real-time, providing sentiment scores (positive, negative, or neutral). 

The system's deployment involved creating a Flask API and using Docker for scalability. The impact of the sentiment tracker was quantified through user surveys, revealing a 30% increase in self-awareness among users, who reported gaining valuable insights into their emotional well-being. This project effectively combined advanced NLP techniques and user feedback to enhance self-awareness and emotional intelligence.
